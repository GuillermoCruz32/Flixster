### Notes

I tried rounding the corners on my images, but something wasn't getting imported properly from the Glide file and this caused my app to crash. I was not able to ever find the source of the bug, so I was not able to finish that stretch story.

### Notes
The only real challenge that I faced happened when I was trying to create a recyler view object in my layout. Even after I added the nessecary libray in my gradle file, my layout did not regocnize the recyler view as an object in my layout. I could not create a proper recyler view object unless I first create an ImageView, and then create my recyler view.
